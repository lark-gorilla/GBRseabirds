# Seabird foraging predictions on the Great Barrier Reef

The Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is arguably the best managed network of marine protected areas (MPA) in the world.
In addition to the mega-diverse coral reef community, for which the network was created to protect,the GBR supports
numerous globally and regionally significant seabird breeding populations, several of which are in decline.
At present seabirds are not considered in zoning activities (which dictate the location of MPAs within the GBR)
because of a critical lack of knowledge on at-sea foraging areas. In order to fill this gap this project will,
for the first time, predict and map at-sea foraging areas for seabird species breeding across the entire GBR.
